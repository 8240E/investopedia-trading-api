Some work for the future, in order of priority:

1. Include options trading (this is a bit complicated)
2. Add the ability to manage multiple competitions
3. Get all securities currently held by the account
4. More elegant string searching in getPortfolioStatus!
5. Break up the trading function into multiple parts? (i.e. buy(), sell(), etc.)
